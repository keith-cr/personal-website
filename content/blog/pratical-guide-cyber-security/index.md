With the internet being a large part of everyone's lives, it's more important than ever to make sure you're using it securely. We have accounts to dozens of websites and apps, even more than we might realize. Many of these accounts are extremely important to us, whether they contain personal information or could be used to impersonate us. That's why I'm compiling this list of best practices for keeping your accounts and devices secure.

These tips are by no means supposed to be comprehensive nor are they the absolutely most secure methods. Instead, they're meant to be a practical balance between security and ease of use. For some accounts, you may not actually care how secure they are and others may be extremely important to you. While ideally, you would be extremely careful with all of your accounts, it's understandable that you may not have the time or the effort. At the very least make sure you secure important accounts like financial, medical, social media, email, etc.

With that said, here are some of my top recommendations, that are universally good practices to keep all of your accounts and devices.

# Secure Passwords
This is something everybody, myself included, can be better at. One of the worst security practices you can have, besides having a [ridiculously insecure password](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateoflahertyuk/2019/04/21/these-are-the-worlds-most-hacked-passwords-is-yours-on-the-list/), is using the same password for multiple accounts. This is super convenient, but also super dangerous. If one of your accounts with this password is compromised, it is then significantly easier to get into another of your accounts.

The best way to greatly improve your passwords is to use a password manager. Ideally, it will generate and store passwords for you securely, so the only password you have to remember is the one to your password manager, as well as maybe the password for your computer and phone. While it may not quite be this simple, using a password manager to store strong, unique passwords for every, or at least most, accounts you use will drastically improve your account security.

There are a lot of great options out there, including [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/) and [1Password](https://1password.com/). The one I would *strongly* recommend avoiding however, is the password manager built into your web browser. These aren't always secure and don't always allow you to access your password on different platforms.

Other than that, pick the one that works best for you and start using a secure, unique password. I recommend each password contain a mix of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers and special characters ($%#^&*!) and be at least 20 characters long. The password manager you choose should let you configure the passwords it generates to match this criteria.

Remember to update your passwords regularly and in the case of a breach. You can check to see if any of your account details have been leaked at [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/).

# Two Factor Authentication (TFA)
No matter how secure you've made your password, there is always a chance someone else could get ahold of it. That's why two factor authentication was invented. Two Factor Authentication adds an extra layer of protection to your account. It requires two different pieces to authenticate, something your know (your password) and something you have (your device). After inputting your password, accounts secured with TFA will also require you to either input a code generated or confirm the login request on your device, such as a smartphone. Therefore, if someone does gain access to your password, they still won't be able to authenticate into your account.

The majority of the platforms you have accounts on should support enabling Two Factor Authentication. Enable it for your account and follow the instructions provided. You'll probably need an app like Google Authenticator or [Authy](https://authy.com/).

# Virtual Private Networks (VPN)
If you use public wifi, whether it be while traveling or on a regular basis, you're putting yourself at risk. Public wifi networks are notoriously insecure and can often be exploited. You can protect yourself by using a Virtual Private Network. Using a VPN routes all your network traffic through that private network, which is encrypted. Therefore, all information you send won't be visible on the network, regardless of whether the site your connecting to using HTTP or HTTPS.
